## Sam DuBois - Review of Code

Overall the packages here look really intersting and cool, but I feel that there is a bit of lacking functional code. It would be great to see some work that utulizes the power of these packages towards some specific task of the project. Overall though it looks like a great start!

Also this code is missing some key elements like a gitignore, would be great to add this so any interaction with the code doesn't reflect in the git status (Non changes specifically)
